# Change-Tile-Metadata
This is a simple windows form program that changes the title metadata from mp4 and wmv files to their current file name. 
Useful to fix plex libraries.
You can select a folder and it will either clear the title metadata for all mp4 and wmv or
set their title tag to the same as the file name.
